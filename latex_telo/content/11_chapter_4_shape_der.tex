\subsection{Shape Derivative in NGSolve}
Since its shown in the previous chapter that the shape derivative $\mathrm{d}J(\Omega)(X)$ actually exists, a formulation
that yields an approxmimate minimizer for the problem at hand can be used. The quadratic penalty method is used 
as the augmented Lagrangian, the formulation for approximate minimizer of (\ref*{energy_dissipation_equation}).
