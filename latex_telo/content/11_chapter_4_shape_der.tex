\subsection{Shape Derivative}
The shape derivative is needed to find a shape that minimizes the given functional.

\subsubsection{Descent Direction}
%Auxillary Problem?
To do some sort of gradient descent we need a negative descent direction. To achieve this we solve the deformation for a positive definite right hand side, which than can be subtracted to achieve a negative direction.
The easiest solution for this is the use of the H1-norm.
